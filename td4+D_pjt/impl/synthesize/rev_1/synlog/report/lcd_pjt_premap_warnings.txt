@W: MT529 :"c:\kitahard\tang_nano\td4+d_pjt\src\top.v":32:4:32:9|Found inferred clock TOP|XTAL_IN which controls 23 sequential elements including count[22:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
